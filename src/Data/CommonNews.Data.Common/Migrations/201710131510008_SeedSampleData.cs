It’s hard to tell what’s louder: the electric guitar, the opera singer or the hundreds of hands clapping. In the courtyard of a building in the historic centre of Turin, in northern Italy, Maksim Cristan and Daria Spada are on stage – standing on their balcony with a guitar modified to look like a sword, and a microphone.
Since 2011 the couple have organised concerts on their balcony every Sunday afternoon. At first it was a way to get to know their neighbours, says Spada, 36, who is originally from Puglia, in southern Italy. Now it’s “a regular event for residents, tourists and passersby”, and “a gift to the city”.
But the free concertino dal balconcino (“concert from the balcony”) appears to be simultaneously adored by the city and under threat.
Ironically, it was Turin’s reputation for being avant garde and a “little Berlin” that drew Cristan and Spada to the city in the first place, says Cristan, 50, who is originally from Croatia. “We are helping to make Turin what we thought it already was.”
For most of the 20th century Turin was an industrial powerhouse as the birthplace of giants like Fiat. Today it is more often included in tourist guides for its alternative and experimental art credentials.
With a population of nearly 890,000, it is a cultural centre of northern Italy – a hub of dance and electronic music production and festivals, and a thriving university city. Turin also has a strong network of long-standing centri sociali – occupied buildings that host music and events and act as centres for autonomous cultural and political life.
But contrasted with its burgeoning reputation as the beating heart of Italy’s progressive scene, is the defence of some residents’ rights to peace and quiet.
This month locals of an area on close to the university and home to many bars that are open late, held a “silent protest” in Piazza Santa Giulia against noise, hanging bed sheets from their balconies to symbolise their lack of sleep.
On the other side of the city centre, the concertino has also come under fire for alleged noise violations, although it is held for just one hour, during daylight hours, once a week.', N'/Content/images/entertainment-1.jpg', CAST(N'2017-10-13T19:35:41.6433064' AS DateTime2), CAST(N'2017-10-13T19:36:44.8519217' AS DateTime2), 0, NULL, N'712f0f37-94c8-495e-a0dc-94ff0ef441f9', 2)

Van Morrison was on blistering form, delivering a dazzling and engaged performance that was as warm and friendly as it was bravura. Which, as long time Morrison watchers know, is not a given. He is always impressive when he plays but he doesn’t always look happy about it. Yet here he was, unleashing the full charge of his extraordinary talent to a couple of hundred fortunate fans.

With another fine new album to promote, Roll With The Punches (his 36th solo album), the legendary star could have opted to unveil it in a much grander setting. In November, Morrison tours prestigious concert halls. But he seems to like these small clubs, which take him back to his R’n’B roots. His seven-piece band were crowded onto a tiny stage, where Morrison stood like a hatchet-faced old bluesman in suit, trilby and sunglasses, inches away from the audience. His only real concession to stardom was a gold-plated microphone and stand.

The band watched their leader with nervous intensity as he called out songs, apparently making his set list up on the spot. But smiles broke out as the musicians established Morrison’s mood, as he nodded vigorously, punched the air for snare shots, and muttered “Yeah! Yeah!” at intricate guitar and trumpet solos. Most of the band played at least two instruments, Morrison himself played three: electric guitar, saxophone and harmonica, all with virtuoso fluidity and feel. But his fourth instrument is the one that still raises goosebumps: his voice.

At 72, Morrison sang like a champion. His breath blowing through the notes like cosmic ululations, swirling and eddying above the piano lines, swooping down with the bass, ricocheting off the drums with staccato repetitions. Whenever his head tipped back, the voice rose, and he embarked on an extemporaneous coda, it was astonishing to behold.', N'/Content/images/entertainment-2.jpg', CAST(N'2017-10-13T19:37:42.0661942' AS DateTime2), NULL, 0, NULL, N'712f0f37-94c8-495e-a0dc-94ff0ef441f9', 3)

Everything Everything turned By The Sea festival into some kind ‘90s rave last night, flooding the retro seaside theme park Dreamland with buoyant dance-influenced bangers so jubilant that you’d never notice their doom-filled lyrics. If the Manchester art-pop four-piece’s new album, ‘A Fever Dream’, grapples with the fear and paranoia that is life in 2017, here they implored us to dance at the end of the world.

There is, ironically, a sense of renewal in Margate, home to festival for the past three years. The coastal Kent town is so cool nowadays that The Libertines recently bought a knackered B&B here; the band plans to transform it – in Carl Barat’s words – into a “a hotel, bar, restaurant, recording studio.” No wonder he and the gang are on the bill this weekend, playing the Winter Gardens venue; Pete probably wants to get a bit of plumbing done after the show.

St Sepulchre-without-Newgate in Holborn, known more widely as the National Musicians’ Church, has rejected pleas from church figures and some of Britain’s most distinguished musicians to keep its doors open as an important concert venue and rehearsal space.

Despite long and robust discussions between Pete Broadbent, the acting bishop of London, and the rector and governing body of St Sepulchre, the church has declined to accept new bookings.

In talks, Broadbent stressed the importance of churches being open to the communities they serve. The acting bishop said: “The Church of England is called to be a welcoming, inclusive and engaging church. I have re-emphasised the importance of this to all those at St Sepulchre.”

Last month, the Rev David Ingall, who moved to St Sepulchre four years ago from the ultra-evangelical Holy Trinity Brompton, wrote to professional and amateur musicians and ensembles to say they could no longer make bookings from the end of 2017.

The decision to stop renting out space to musicians had not been easy, Ingall said, but added: “We have been conscious of the challenges of using a space dedicated to worship for non-religious hiring.”

The singer Aled Jones, the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber, the composers John Rutter and James MacMillan, and Judith Weir, the first female master of the Queen’s music, were among more than 50 signatories to a letter urging a reversal of the ban, saying they could not understand why the church was willing to abandon its “unique national cultural remit”.', N'/Content/images/entertainment-4.jpg', CAST(N'2017-10-13T19:56:01.3820715' AS DateTime2), NULL, 0, NULL, N'712f0f37-94c8-495e-a0dc-94ff0ef441f9', 3)

One feels they deserve it, and not purely for sticking the course. Since 2005’s Alligator, they have put out collections of remarkable consistency: Boxer, High Violet and Trouble Will Find Me. Sleep Well Beast, the latest, evolves their sound – more drum machines, more laptops – without losing any of the earnest poetry that has inspired their rise. Their run of four nights at the Hammersmith Apollo, which started on Monday night, represents a triumphant homecoming of sorts. London was where they first started to take off.

The band have always stood out from the indie rock masses by their dogged avoidance of cliche, both musically and, more importantly, with their lyrics. Matt Berninger is one of the most gifted writers in rock. He sings about the things that really matter to him: love, fatherhood, the sundry anxieties of being a privileged white man in America. Over the years this has led to a certain amount of teasing, that the band are a kind of Nirvana for people who shop at Waitrose, not that it ever seems to bother them.

And to judge by the crowd, which it would not be easy to mistake for Stormzy’s, say, there is also a fair amount of empathy for his predicament. There were many men in glasses, a few men in suits, and at least four Barbour jackets. In London in recent years The National have played at Alexandra Palace and the O2, so they must feel the smaller, 4,000-capacity Apollo suits them better. During the sombre opener, Nobody Else Will Be There, the crowd fell into a kind of hushed reverie. One man trying to sing along was shushed, as if his phone had gone off at the opera.

On it, through minimalist, angular electropop, the New Zealand musician framed herself as an anthropologist of teenage life, observing youth from the outskirts. A meticulous over-thinker, she worried about the fame she didn’t yet have, and how it would affect the experiences she hadn’t yet enjoyed. She sat in the passenger seat of her own life, only 16 years old but already “over being told to throw my hands up in the air”.

With her second album, this year’s aptly named Melodrama (which she wrote with Bleachers member and Taylor Swift collaborator Jack Antonoff), things have changed. Emerging from a well-documented relationship bruised but reborn, she’s found a place where she can revel in all the explosive, contradictory shards of her emotions, no longer treating her own youth with suspicion.

She’s still in the passenger seat, but only because she’s on her way to a place where she can drink, dance, “spill my guts beneath the outdoor light” and indulge in the hedonistic joy of being young. “I think joy is so much more transcendent than pain,” she told Marc Maron on his American podcast WTF. “It’s really easy to make work out of pain, but choosing joy is quite difficult, and quite noble.”

Last night, in front of 10,000 people, she chose joy.

But this superb revival of David Pountney’s masterly 2007 production for WNO reminds us that it is also a work of unique power and grandeur. 

The tangled story of the internecine struggles around the accession of Peter the Great makes House of Cards look like Andy Pandy. There are no winners in the feuds and intrigues between the tsar’s faction, the Old Believers, the repressive oligarchs and the westernising liberals, but the biggest losers are without doubt the Russian people, left out in the cold without hope or justice. No other opera deals more forcefully with the dirty business of politics, and the way that it muddies good and evil.

The almost cynical bleakness of the message is enriched by Mussorgsky’s raw yet full-blooded score, presented here in the version edited by Shostakovich (with a regrettable schlock ending added by Rimsky-Korsakov). WNO’s brilliant new Music Director Tomas Hanus brings out all the brazen primitivism in the harmonies and the impassioned lyricism in the vocal writing, as well as revelling in the sumptuous romanticism of the Overture and Dance of the Persian Slave (the latter strikingly performed with no holds barred by Beate Vollack). The orchestral playing is thrillingly pungent.

There are no obvious stars in the cast, and the smaller roles are taken with distinction by members of the company’s fabulous chorus – one who stands out in particular is Monika Sawa as the fanatic Susanna. Robert Hayward and Adrian Dwyer play the appalling Khovansky father and son; Mark Le Brocq is the effete Prince Golitsyn, Simon Bailey the cunning Boyar Shaklovity, and Miklos Sebestyen and Sara Fulgoni the backward-looking ascetics Dosifei and Marfa.', N'/Content/images/entertainment-8.jpg', CAST(N'2017-10-13T19:58:49.3546790' AS DateTime2), CAST(N'2017-10-13T19:59:15.7171868' AS DateTime2), 0, NULL, N'712f0f37-94c8-495e-a0dc-94ff0ef441f9', 2)

Pekka Kuusisto is a violinist who does things differently. As if playing the first British performance of Daniel Bjarnason’s whacky Violin Concerto wasn’t enough, he followed it with an encore he described “a melancholy Swedish wedding march” and co-opted the Philharmonia Orchestra into humming a pedal note, before reappearing in a late-night gig in the Festival Hall foyer to give Finnish folk music a contemporary twist. All in an evening’s work for Kuusisto, and it would have been the same even if this season-opening concert of the Philharmonia hadn’t also been launching the Southbank Centre’s Nordic Music Days.

Kuusisto’s style certainly inspired Bjarnason’s new concerto, written specifically for him and premiered in Los Angeles last month. True, the work also adheres to traditional concerto principles by showing off the soloist, requiring virtuosity in some moments and dialogue with the orchestra at others. But only a piece composed with Kuusisto in mind would require its soloist to whistle in duo alone with himself before spreading that whistle out into the orchestral parts. With a player always ready to act out his sense of music as theatre, the solo violin’s grunts and snarls become part of a lively soundscape. Although Bjarnason’s writing has muscular vigour, he writes with striking clarity even when the textures are busy, and the music comes to rest with utmost delicacy. Teeming with riffs and folk influences, this concerto may seem uneven, but then that is maybe its point.

Esa-Pekka Salonen’s adventurous programme featured not one but two Icelandic composers, and the concert had opened with Anna Thorvaldsdottir’s Aeriality, a more predictable but highly effective piece nevertheless. Though it is about more than simply the mood it creates, this is atmospheric music full of stillness – despite undercurrents – and mystery, the sonic equivalent perhaps of the art installations of Olafur Eliasson. At one point a sonorous tune breaks out, starting in the cellos, but soon it is reabsorbed.', N'/Content/images/entertainment-9.jpg', CAST(N'2017-10-13T19:59:57.2525625' AS DateTime2), NULL, 0, NULL, N'712f0f37-94c8-495e-a0dc-94ff0ef441f9', 2)

The 2009 album from the superstar Canadian jazz singer and pianist was called Quiet Nights, and the new one, which she’s now showcasing on a lavish world tour, is entitled Turn up the Quiet.

For much of her Royal Albert Hall gig on Wednesday night, that’s exactly what I wished she would do. Almost everything was at a whispered volume, words emerging with breathy hesitancy. Often she would sing just one verse, hands itching to be at the keyboard, and then push the microphone away, as if she were glad to be rid of it. In Sunny Side of the Street, she actually played the last line of the song at the piano, instead of singing it.

It was odd to find the world’s favourite jazz singer so reluctant to sing. Especially as, on those rare moments when she actually flexed her vocal muscle, it proved to be wondrous thing, smoky and thick-grained. Krall’s latest album is her much-touted return to jazz standards, after forays into songwriting and pop material that alienated many of her jazz fans, but won her many new ones.

In line with the album’s title, the songs were mostly low-key and intimate, with moonlight-through-the-trees backdrops and moody arrangements for a quintet of old sparring partners. Krall’s rendition of Cole Porter’s Night and Day was typical of the way she would outline a harmonically searching introduction at the piano, which seemed to be leading us in one direction. Then with a jolt the song would carry us somewhere else, and it was the friction between the introductions and the song itself that accounted for much of the evening’s dusky emotional complication. That, and the long tapering conclusions, often spun out deliciously by violinist Stuart Duncan and guitarist Anthony Wilson in drowsy dialogue.

Bassist John Clayton Jr and drummer Karriem Riggins were no less subtle, and in Peggy Lee’s I Don’t Know Enough About You they delivered a welcome kick of energy. Here finally the evening came to life, with Krall giving us a rare display of her pianistic and vocal gifts working together at full throttle.
